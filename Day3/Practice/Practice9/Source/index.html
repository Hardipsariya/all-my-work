    <h3>Var</h3>
    <p>The var statement is used to declare a variable in JavaScript. A variable declared with the var keyword is
        defined throughout the program.</p><br>
    <p>It has global scope.</p><br>
    <p>Variable declared with var keyword can be re-declared and updated in the same scope.</p>

    <h3> Let</h3>
    <p>The let statement is used to declare a local variable in TypeScript. It is similar to the var keyword, but it has
        some restriction in scoping in comparison of the var keyword. </p><br>
    <p>It is limited to block scope.</p><br>
    <p>Variable declared with let keyword can be updated but not re-declared.</p>
